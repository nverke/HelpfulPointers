# Create a class from scratch (look it up) that implements a stack.
# The class should have the following three functions.
# Push(n): puts n on the top of the stack.
# Pop(): removes and returns the value on top of the stack.
# Peek(): returns but does not remove the value ontop of the stack.
#
# Examples:
# -------------------
# stack = new Stack()
# stack.push(3)
# stack.push(6)
# stack.push(4)
# stack.peek() [should return 4]
# stack.pop() [also returns 4]
# stack.pop() [should return 6]
# -------------------
