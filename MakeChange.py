# Create a function that makes change for a given amount of money.
# The function will take in an integer value represnting the amount of money
# in cents to make change with. The function should also take in an array
# of integers representing the values of the coins being used to make change.
# The function should then return the smallest possible number of coins
# to make change with.
#
# Examples:
# -------------------
# amount = 314
# denomenations = [10,100,4]
# output = 5 (3*100, 1*10, 1*4)
# -------------------
# amount = 373
# denomenations = [10,100,4]
# output = 0 (cannot be done)
# -------------------
