# Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns true if
# the strings are one letter away from eachother and false if they are not.
# Two strings are considered "oneAway" if adding/removing one letter results in
# the other string or one substitution in one string results in the other.
#
# Examples:
# -------------------
# input1 = "Bois"
# input2 = "Boiz"
# output = true
# -------------------
# input1 = "Bois"
# input2 = "Boi"
# output = true
# -------------------
# input1 = "Boise"
# input2 = "Boi"
# output = false
